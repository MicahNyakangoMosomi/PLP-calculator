# Simple Python Calculator

This is a basic calculator program written in Python.  
It performs simple arithmetic operations between two numbers.

## Features
- Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`)
- Accepts floating point or integer inputs
- Handles division by zero with an error message

##  How It Works
1. The program asks the user to enter the first number.
2. Then it asks for the second number.
3. It prompts for an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).
4. It performs the chosen operation.
5. The result is displayed in the format:  
   `num1 operation num2 = result`

If the user tries to divide by zero, the program prints an error and stops.

##  Example
```text
Enter the first number: 10  
Enter the second number: 5  
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): +  
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
